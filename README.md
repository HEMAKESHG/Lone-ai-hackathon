ClarityAI ðŸ“œâœ¨
From Complexity to Clarity: An AI-powered legal assistant to demystify documents, identify risks, and connect you with help.

The Problem
Legal documents like rental agreements, contracts, and terms of service are filled with complex jargon, creating a power imbalance where people can unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms. This exposes them to significant financial and legal risks.
